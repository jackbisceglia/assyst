# Assyst


An App or website for finding other students on your college campus to collaborate with on projects. Students may input interests, their major, preferred group size, etc. and be matched with a project, or they may post their own project to be matched with others.

# Things to Consider
- Ability to change search radius (only on campus, x mile radius, anywhere in the world, etc)
- If the search is purely for the campus, should students have to verify that their email is the correct one for their campus?
- Focus on what sets this product apart from just making a facebook group dedicated to finding partners
- Front End --> React/JS
- Back End --> Spring or Django / Java or Python

# To Do
- Sketch out basic UI
- Research Django vs Spring
- Learn Django/Spring
